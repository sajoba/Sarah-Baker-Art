			<p class="bio">
				I grew up with an artist mother who thought art was not a secure way to live so as a teenager i  was directed towards a more academic university. Yet having always had contact with clay because of my mother, i discovered i had an affinity with it. <br> This meant that when i found myself working as a prop maker immediately after finishing my degree i was very quick to model up sculptures needed for the plays i worked on, and i started to specialise in scenic sculpture. This led on to a wider spectrum of commercial sculpture, and fine art sculpture, working for architects, design companies and established artists. During this period i also started producing a small body of my own work. A stone carving course, led to my transferring to Italy where I now live.
