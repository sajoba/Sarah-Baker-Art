Death makes one reflect on life, and I realise that there are many ways to view it, and how much that view depends essentially on your age. It seems to me that a poem can shine an intense light on its author's heart and thoughts. As artists it is easy to forget this important communicative side of art."

  'A Study of the working methods of  Leonardo da Vinci in the context of the 1473 “Val’d’Arno” landscape drawing and Madonna di Piazza.;Leonardo’s 1473 landscape sketch is considered here from the viewpoint of an artist. Initially visually analysing the sketch, in order to establish how Leonardo would have created it, and subsequently using both visual and documentary evidence to attempt to prove that Leonardo visited a particular place in central Tuscany in his formative years. The apparent connection of this place also with two annunciation paintings, leads to re-consider the level of Leonardo’s involvement in Verrocchio’s Pistoia altarpiece.;The 1473 drawing;In his maturity Leonardo da Vinci usually carried a small notebook tied to his waist, always ready to note down and store anything of interest that he saw, wherever he was (1).;',

  'The results of his observations filled thousands of pages and often concerned recurring themes: such as those regarding mothers and sons, many examples of which can be easily found amongst his sketches as well as seen in some of the few paintings he left behind(2). Yet we do not know who of any of the women or small children that he drew together were.;The mountains, rocks, hills and plains that Leonardo painted disappearing into the distance and forming the background in his paintings almost certainly also derive from observation and sketches, done directly in front of the subject, but these painted hills and valleys have remained just as anonymous as his lovely young women with their playful babies.;The first dated landscape study by Leonardo da Vinci that we have today  was signed on the 5th August 1473 (3).',

  'The small sketch (fig. 1), is often described as a drawing of the Val d’Arno (4) and the manner in which the marks were made on the paper, mainly with apparently free quickly laid lines, meant that it has been traditionally held to be drawn from observation (5). This would mean that on the 5th August 1473 the 21 year old artist sat himself down, looked out over the valley, and made this sketch of something that actually existed, and which almost certainly still exists today if not in exactly the same way(6).;Leonardo believed that looking at and drawing from nature, rather than copying other works of art, was essential for artistic development. In a rare example of him actually commenting on other artists he cites Giotto and Massaccio as worthy of admiration because they studied nature and brought what they learned back into their paintings (7) .',

  'The only hard evidence we have of places Leonardo had seen up to the age of 21 are Vinci, from documentation deriving from his grandfather, and Florence, where the earliest mention of him is in 1468 in a rhyming chronicle written by the painter Giovanni de’ Santis.(8)This means that we can say without doubt that Leonardo had travelled the land between Vinci and Florence at least once by 1473, and so he had indeed journeyed through the valley in which the Arno flows as it continues its way down towards the coast. There is no documentary proof of any other place he visited outside of Florence before he put pen to paper on August 5th 1473.;Whereas people come and go and vegetation and buildings change over a relatively short span of time, none of the hills and mountains Leonardo sat down before and sketched are unlikely to have changed completely and beyond all recognition over the past five hundred plus years.',

  'Various historians have scoured the area around Leonardo’s home town of Vinci trying to locate a view point similar to that in the 1473 sketch, but as yet to no avail (9), because, like any artist past or present, Leonardo can only have drawn, or developed his ideas, from the things he had direct contact with. Subsequently a doubt about the nature of the drawing has begun to grow and although few seem to question that it is at least meant to be the area around the Arno valley, more recently it has begun to be described with less certainty as “maybe” drawn from observation (10). It has been thought that the hill in the distance could be a drawing of Monsummano Terme, 8 miles from Vinci (11) yet it has proved impossible to find a place in the area that can be said to reveal a view very similar to that of the sketch, thus most researchers today tend to conclude, like Kemp (12), that the drawing is based on a familiar Tuscan landscape but most probably drawn from memory.',

  'Although this conclusion could be justified as a valid reflection of Leonardo’s remark that a painted landscape can be deliberately used to bring to mind other real landscapes (13) this sketch displays the type of spontaneous drawing that suggests the observation of an actual place, therefore it would have represented a real and recognisable landscape, even if drawn from memory, if only it could be identified.'
